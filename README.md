ðŸ”¥ Code is life, and Iâ€™m living it. Iâ€™m Aman â€” a web and app dev addict, crafting sleek user experiences and solving real-world puzzles with tech.

ðŸ’» Currently hacking my way through React Native to bring apps to life. Always down to team up on front-end or mobile projects that push boundaries.

ðŸ“¬ Hit me up: LinkedIn or ******@gmail.com.
âš¡ From gaming dreams to coding obsessions â€” now I build the stuff I once played.

Code, coffee, repeat. Letâ€™s create something legendary. ðŸš€
